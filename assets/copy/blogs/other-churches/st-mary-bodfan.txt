There was something a little "Craggy Island" about this tiny 13th Century church overlooking Barmouth Bay. Still actively used after all this time (but eerily deserted on this occasion) this church, one of the most notable in Wales, is remarkably well preserved - but in desperate need of a gardener!

The Church of St. Mary and Bodfan is a Grade 1 listed building constructed between 1200 and 1250. The small nave is lined with substantial Norman pillars with Early English arches, the roof is 16th century beams, the collection boxes date to the 17th century and two 5th century Christian burial stones (Calixtus Stones) now rest here. You will also observe that over this time the church has developed a tremendous lean (see photos).

This is not a church to visit on your own after dark! Surrounded by a sea of graves (many of which are elaborately carved with doves and anchors) the heavy wooden entrance door eventually creaks open and you step into a dimly lit, tiny and intimate place of worship. Outside there appears to be an old crypt or some other structure once used by St Marys, but the neck high bramble forest prevents you from exploring this mysterious black doorway. And at the far end of the graveyard a small jetty... what the possible cargos were is left to the reader's imagination.

After enjoying this lovely little church by the sea I thoroughly recommend you march a few miles further North and explore Harlech Castle!
