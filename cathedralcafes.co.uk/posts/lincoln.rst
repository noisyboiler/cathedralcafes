.. TEASER_END

It was early on a bright Sunday in May; surely few of the travellers filling the concourse of King's Cross station had a day in prospect as exciting as that of Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh, embarking, full of hope and anticipation, on the inaugural journey of their tour of the gift shops and cafeteria of England's cathedrals.

Not even the pounding rain that greeted them in Lincoln could dampen their enthusiasm; the cathedral was visible through the gloom, towering on a hill at the heart of the historic city. Before heading to the church, the trio thought it prudent to fortify their fibres with a snifter and spot of scran in a local boozer: The Still on Saltergate proved accommodating, and offered the excellent value for money The Spesh so appreciates.

The downpour lessened, and before long, Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh were climbing the glistening cobbles up the steep hill to the cathedral. Pokey little bookshops and curiosity-retailers lined the street, which The Spesh thought endearing, and Shrub found twee and absurd. But, once at the summit, few could fail to be impressed by the imposing frontage of the cathedral.

Through sheer chance, our adventurous trio arrived just as the afternoon tour was about to begin. They were quick to sign on, and were soon clambering up the spiral staircases within the great towers behind a spritely and knowledgeable guide. The tour gave an insight into the behind-the-scenes struggle to our great cathedrals upright. From the marks left by the mediaeval craftsmen who shaped the intricate limestone blocks, to the tonnes of steel and concrete fixed inside the tilting towers of the west front, there were constant reminders of the human ingenuity on which our these surprisingly fragile monuments still depend.

Much of the modern interior owes a lot to a Victorian restoration; they inherited a building in poor repair and open to the elements and the predations of pigeons. It is now much neater, and shown to best effect from the vantage point of the high gallery above the entrance. The tour also offered a fascinating visit to the loft. Under the roof's sturdy oak beams, a glass case contained a scale model of Lincoln cathedral in the middle ages, before its spire collapsed in a storm. This colossal wooden addition to the central tower doubles its height from today's 80 metres. Remember the cathedral is on a substantial hill in the broad Lincolnshire plain, and the impression on Johnny Middle-Ages must have been quite breathtaking.

From this oversized attic, a door opened to the exterior, and impressive views across Lincolnshire. The sight of the dual carriageways and industrial parks that fringed the city filled The Shrub with a deep reverence. Before becoming a cathedral in its own right, Lincoln was part of a giant diocese that stretched from the mud of the Humber Estuary to the gentle Thameside scenery of South Oxfordshire; territory, The Spesh silently noted to himself, studded with some of his favourite examples of today's great cathedrals, the parabolic powerstation cooling towers beneath their gently heaving clouds of steam. Sadly none were visible through the rain, that had begun, again.

To the cafeteria: a pleasant enough little stop, although pots of tea and slices of cake were not enough for our expeditionary troupe; they were soon supping local bitters in a smart drinker on Castle Hill decorated chiefly by framed prints of Avro Lancasters and squadron stickers left by aircrews visiting one of the county's many bomber bases. That was not the last beermonger Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh visited before getting home, particularly if you count the bar in the buffet car of the London-bound inter-city against which it was necessary to perch because no seats remained on the train.

Cloisters Cafe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Red Lion of the cafe circuit, at Lincoln Cathedral you'll drink at The Cloisters - 
small, tidy, calm and well presented. Solid wood furniture. Nice colour scheme. The tea was good. However, cakes were served in plastic wrapping.

Trivia
