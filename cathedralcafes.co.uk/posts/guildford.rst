Our heroes began their trip to the attractive market town of Guildford with lunch in the White House, a busy riverside  pub near the station. Shrub arrived with his family after a gruelling car trip across the motorways of southern England, and the beer garden soon heaved with the pushchairs and tupperware that tumbled out of his Peugeot. It was a pleasant spot, and our troupe were soon fortified for their stroll to the cathedral.

.. TEASER_END

Sited on a prominent hill at the foot of the Hog’s Back ridge, Guildford cathedral enjoys a fantastic location. The angel at the top of the cathedral’s tower was recently regilded courtesy of the telecoms companies who own transmitters in her torso. She now shimmers in the morning sun, beaming phone chatter across the Surrey landscape, with each change in the wind swinging her to face a new spectacular view.

The building, began in 1936, is as tasteful modern interpretation of the traditional English cathedral: no radical change of layout or fancy materials: the interior is clad in unadorned caramel-coloured limestone: the exterior is a giant brick structure reminiscent of the pre-war power stations. It was built slowly through the mid-twentieth century as funds allowed. Construction stopped during the second world war leaving partially-complete works on the hill that many locals were convinced made ideal waymarkers for the Luftwaffe. In the 1950s, the cash-strapped diocese invited the town’s residents to buy individual bricks and have their names marked on the clay. A brick by the Queen remains on display. Now, fifty years \
after the cathedral was consecrated, a new funding crisis looms: the roof has aged badly. The ceiling’s deterioration is clearly visible and the whole structure needs to be substantially replaced; the cost will be high: just removing all the asbestos will cost millions. The hat is being passed round again: let’s hope the IT consultants and merchant bankers who fill the borough dig deep.

The trip closed with a visit to the cathedral’s refectory. This brought back bittersweet memories for The Spesh: it was the venue for his grandmother’s wake. The bright room was spacious and reassuring in the tradition of the better 1960s architecture. The tea and cakes were enjoyable. Opening hours are limited: try to check this before your visit.

Finally, an odd bit of trivia: movie fans will recognise Guildford cathedral from the 1976 film The Omen, where the infant antichrist refuses to cross the cathedral’s threshold, screaming from the back of an ambassadorial car at the sight of the building’s understated facade. Readers will be reassured that Shrub’s own offspring remained placid and content throughout the visit.
