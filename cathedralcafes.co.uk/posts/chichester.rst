	<div class="teaser">

	Chichester, "the most typical English Cathedral", was a well equipped cafe, has it's own treasury and accommodates one of our most famous composers.

	On the river Lavant, just beneath the South Downs (and conveniently opposite a House of Frasier) we have an 11th century church where a bishop sits rather comfortably. In this Sussex city with it's Roman and Anglo-Saxon and Norman footnotes, we have a tidy little cathedral.

	Must-Dos: Find Holst, wait for the falcans, eat cake.

.. TEASER_END

Set between pretty precincts of handsome cottages and the town centre of this characterful market town, Chichester cathedral is a structure of which locals must be very proud. It also had a handy bike rack by the entrance: a useful feature for Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh because they cycled all the way there, and categorically did not (as has been suggested by gossiping malcontents eager to sneer at the trio's adventure) quickly give up on cycling and gratefully drag their bikes onto the first Chichester-bound train they could find. 
 
This cathedral is just a few miles from the sea, and has long been a landmark for sailors. Plentiful information boards explained the salt-laden sea breezes also led to rapid erosion of the building's stone. An ongoing and (it was made very clear) expensive programme of works was necessary to keep the carvings from wearing away. Donation machines, able to take debit or credit cards, were dotted around to allow visitors to make their own contribution to this noble effort. Other money-making schemes include a full programme of live music; a concert by the band of the Royal Marines meant the nave was out of bounds for much of the afternoon. This was not such a sacrifice: our heroes made themselves comfortable in the cathedral's cafe: its garden was delightful, and the homemade cakes could not be faulted.
