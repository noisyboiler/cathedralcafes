No wonder folk mistake this for the city's cathedral - this is "the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England".

It's a marvel of Gothic architecture. The North entrance has a 7 pointed decorated arch and the spire competes well with the tower blocks across the river. There are intricate carvings, bosses, arches and vaults throughout with astonishing patterns.

It has a rich nautical history and indeed once overlooked the thoroughfare of the 15th century harbour; the start and end of many voyages to America, but now is surrounded by passing cars and the muddy, tidal Avon.

It's tended to with love and affection and on each of my numerous visits (mostly to purchase more Pipe Angel badges) I've been warmly welcomed. And now St Mary Redcliffe has opened it's own cafe. Truly this is a challenge to Bristol cathedral!
