	<div class="teaser">

	Occasionally a city has more than one CofE cathedral and it shoudn't come as much suprise to you that London is one of them. As a church this one is much older (pre-conquest) than Wren's little design and much more like a comfy armchair; we loved this little beauty. This choice for two 17th century playwrites is a tiny and condessed church where the photography tax is well worthwile.

	Must-Dos: Find the 10th century stones, find the memorial to W. Shakespeare, drink tea
