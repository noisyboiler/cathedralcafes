	<p>Occasionally a city has more than one C of E cathedral and it shouldn't come as much of a surprise to you that London is one of them. As a church this one is much older (pre-conquest) than Wren's little design and much more like a comfy armchair - we loved this little church. This choice for two 17th century bards is a tiny and condensed church where the photography tax is well worthwile.</p>

Clositers Cafe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside the noisy heart of London but away from the trendies of Borough market, the tourist mayhem and the suits of the city, touch-down in this modern cafe with quaint touches such as hand painted tea pots and mediocre paintings on sale for in excess of 1000 pounds. We had three home cooked cakes here, the best of which was a delicious honey, and walnut and the tea was superb.
