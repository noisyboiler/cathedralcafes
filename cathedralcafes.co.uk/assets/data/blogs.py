travellers filling the concourse of King's Cross station had a day in \
prospect as exciting as that of Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh, embarking, \
full of hope and anticipation, on the inaugural journey of their tour of \
the gift shops and cafeteria of England's cathedrals.\

Not even the pounding rain that greeted them in Lincoln could dampen their \
enthusiasm; the cathedral was visible through the gloom, towering on a hill \
at the heart of the historic city. Before heading to the church, the trio \
thought it prudent to fortify their fibres with a snifter and spot of scran \
in a local boozer: The Still on Saltergate proved accommodating, and offered \
the excellent value for money The Spesh so appreciates.

The downpour lessened, and before long, Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh were \
climbing the glistening cobbles up the steep hill to the cathedral. Pokey \
little bookshops and curiosity-retailers lined the street, which The Spesh \
thought endearing, and Shrub found twee and absurd. But, once at the summit, \
few could fail to be impressed by the imposing frontage of the cathedral.

Through sheer chance, our adventurous trio arrived just as the afternoon \
tour was about to begin. They were quick to sign on, and were soon clambering \
up the spiral staircases within the great towers behind a spritely and \
knowledgeable guide. The tour gave an insight into the behind-the-scenes \
struggle to our great cathedrals upright. From the marks left by the \
mediaeval craftsmen who shaped the intricate limestone blocks, to the tonnes \
of steel and concrete fixed inside the tilting towers of the west front, \
there were constant reminders of the human ingenuity on which our these \
surprisingly fragile monuments still depend.

Much of the modern interior owes a lot to a Victorian restoration; they \
inherited a building in poor repair and open to the elements and the \
predations of pigeons. It is now much neater, and shown to best effect from \
the vantage point of the high gallery above the entrance. The tour also \
offered a fascinating visit to the loft. Under the roof's sturdy oak beams, \
a glass case contained a scale model of Lincoln cathedral in the middle \
ages, before its spire collapsed in a storm. This colossal wooden addition \
to the central tower doubles its height from today's 80 metres. Remember the \
cathedral is on a substantial hill in the broad Lincolnshire plain, and the \
impression on Johnny Middle-Ages must have been quite breathtaking.

From this oversized attic, a door opened to the exterior, and impressive \
views across Lincolnshire. The sight of the dual carriageways and industrial \
parks that fringed the city filled The Shrub with a deep reverence. Before \
becoming a cathedral in its own right, Lincoln was part of a giant diocese \
that stretched from the mud of the Humber Estuary to the gentle Thameside \
scenery of South Oxfordshire; territory, The Spesh silently noted to himself, \
studded with some of his favourite examples of today's great cathedrals, \
the parabolic powerstation cooling towers beneath their gently heaving clouds \
of steam. Sadly none were visible through the rain, that had begun, again.

To the cafeteria: a pleasant enough little stop, although pots of tea and \
slices of cake were not enough for our expeditionary troupe; they were soon \
supping local bitters in a smart drinker on Castle Hill decorated chiefly by \
framed prints of Avro Lancasters and squadron stickers left by aircrews \
visiting one of the county's many bomber bases. That was not the last \
beermonger Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh visited before getting home, \
particularly if you count the bar in the buffet car of the London-bound \
inter-city against which it was necessary to perch because no seats remained \
on the train."""}, {

those other bemused adventurers on a perambulatory tour of England, the \
Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club. Doubtless the authenticated \
accounts of Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh's own wanderings, recorded herewith, \
will, in time, be regarded with the same esteem as those of Dickens' heroes. \
With that in mind, let it be noted that, like the noble Pickwickians, Shrub, \
Sneak and The Spesh recognise the principle of every member defraying his own \
travelling expenses.

Fittingly, and due to complete accident, our plucky trio arrived in the \
historic Medway town in the midst of a Dickensian Festival. Held every \
Christmas, this spectacle features locals in period costume, tasty mulled \
wine sold in aid of veterans of the Afghan campaigns, roast chestnuts, and \
crowds so big as to require marshals with megaphones and high visibility \
jackets. It was a lot of fun.

It took some time for our adventurers to make their way down the High Street; \
Sneak and Shrub became mesmerised by a shop selling cutlasses and muskets, \
while The Spesh was waylaid in a bakers with a cream horn clear-out. But they \
finally made their way to the town's handsome church and its charming frontage.

As Britain's second oldest cathedral, Rochester far predates the gargantuan \
Gothic showboats that dominate the British cathedral scene, possessing \
instead a compact and intimate feel to which Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh \
quickly warmed. Its homely Norman architecture packs a lot in; this is \
emphasised by the strict one-way system enforced by Cathedral staff, \
following a circuitous route that allows the visitor to tick-off the many \
treasures and points of note they pass. Particularly poignant were the Royal \
Engineers' shrapnel-scarred standards, and a new fresco in the \
Byzantine-style which colourfully celebrated the building's 700th anniversary.

Eventually, our selfless trio reached the cafeteria, which was packed, it \
being Festival day. Cakes were home-made and enjoyable, but Sneak had doubts \
about the tea. All tables were taken, but there were seats in the gardens; a \
bit chilly, it being December, but not unbearable. Like all the Cathedral's \
grounds, the gardens were very well kept, and will present a delightful scene \
come the spring. Our travellers later dropped-by the temporary caf√© in the \
crypt set up to cater for the crowds; after the queues of the official \
refectory, it actually offered a much more pleasant experience: drinks were \
even served by a vicar.

Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh ended their day in a boisterous boozer by \
Rochester Castle, where The Spesh explained the chief differences between \
Men of Kent (those rumbustious fellows born east of the Medway) and Kentish \
Men (their effete westerly cousins). Or is it the other way round, with the \
Men of Kent in the west? The Spesh could not really remember; yet more \
evidence that his supposed learning can only be considered such in the \
Pickwickian sense of the term."""}, {

Exeter. After weeks of rain, a stroll through the town's sun-soaked \
streets heartened Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh no end. They soon reached \
the cathedral's splendid grounds brimming with contented westcountryfolk \
lounging in the midday warmth. Our heroes' only complaint was the \
amplified Spanish guitar music that boomed through the scene and prompted \
them to find lunch elsewhere: they enjoyed a refreshing drink in The Ship \
Inn, with its doubtful links to Sir Francis Drake, and an al fresco \
ploughmans in the yet-more tenously-connected Drake's Cafe, next to House \
of Fraser.

Squat, long and broad, Exeter cathedral has a unique layout. There is no \
central tower - the collapse of Winchester's gave the bishop \
commissioning Exeter's Gothic rebuild the jitters. Instead, two Norman \
towers from the original structure flank the later nave: this plan gives \
Exeter the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling of all England's \
cathedrals: its attractively-coloured stonework reminded Sneak of his \
mum's new patio.

The choir was practicing while Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh ambled round \
the building's interior; the collected voices and many-piped organ \
filled the great space with delicate and timeless harmonies, and Shrub \
enjoyed watching the enthusiastic conductor chappie encourage his \
diverse charges to refine and perfect their performance. The singing \
continued during the early-afternoon tour, where a cravatted guide in a \
cream suit occasionally had to pause his amusing tales of bishop \
this-or-that when a particularly-tumultuous crescendo of voices \
overwhelmed his own. He also punctuated his talk with updates on the \
qualifying for the Spanish grand prix, which The Spesh found helpful. \

Amongst the usual bits and bobs that fill the nation's cathedrals \
(stacks of chairs, scarred regimental standards, pianos under tarps), \
Exeter's treasures include the giant carved bishop's seat (saved from a \
German bomb in 1942 by cathedral bosses who shifted it to storage) and \
an astronomical clock that was once the only timepiece in the \
westcountry. The clock was guarded by a cathedral cat who prowled its \
workings to snare the mice that chewed the fat-soaked ropes carrying its \
weights, and supposedly inspired (i.e. did not inspire) the lyrics to \
Hickory Dickory Dock. Another impressive feature is the magnificent \
carved screen at the front of the cathedral, loaded with various \
apostles and assorted Biblical bods at different stages of erosion. \

Exeter's cafe is a real find. The trio struggled to find anything to \
fault in this delighful eatery, with its lovely setting, cheerful staff \
and tasty homemade cakes. The visitor can choose between settling down \
in its magnificent Victorian gothic revival interior (with glowing \
stained glass and an ornately-decorated stone ceiling) or heading \
outside to benches beneath the cathedral itself. Our adventurers chose \
to sun themselves while enjoying a big pot of tea and a generous serving \
of scones, jam and clotted cream. The cream tea was, of course, \
obligatory (given they were in Devon) and, luckily, completely \
delicious. Indeed, The Spesh ate far too much - he still felt slightly \
queasy hours later."""}, {

the town centre of this characterful market town, Chichester cathedral \
is a structure of which locals must be very proud. It also had a handy \
bike rack by the entrance: a useful feature for Shrub, Sneak and The \
Spesh because they cycled all the way there, and categorically did not \
(as has been suggested by gossiping malcontents eager to sneer at the \
trio's adventure) quickly give up on cycling and gratefully drag \
their bikes onto the first Chichester-bound train they could find.

This cathedral is just a few miles from the sea, and has long been a \
landmark for sailors. Plentiful information boards explained the \
salt-laden sea breezes also led to rapid erosion of the building's stone. \
An ongoing and (it was made very clear) expensive programme of works was \
necessary to keep the carvings from wearing away. Donation machines, able \
to take debit or credit cards, were dotted around to allow visitors to \
make their own contribution to this noble effort. Other money-making \
schemes include a full programme of live music; a concert by the band of \
the Royal Marines meant the nave was out of bounds for much of the \
afternoon. This was not such a sacrifice: our heroes made themselves \
comfortable in the cathedral's cafe: its garden was delightful, and \
the homemade cakes could not be faulted."""}, {

sun shone full beam and Norwich‚Äôs inhabitants filled the city‚Äôs pretty \
streets - even the bearded volunteers at a Socialist Worker stall in \
the market square seemed relaxed and cheerful. Shrub, Sneak and The \
Spesh had also blinked disbelievingly at the weather. Our heroes had a \
generous lunch in a delightful historic pub called The Dove, before \
moving on to the expansive and attractive cathedral precincts.

Norwich‚Äôs cathedral is a mainly Norman structure, knocked up with \
limestone imported from Northern France. Its handsome design has a \
simplicity and solidity that contrasts with the elaborate Gothic \
wedding cakes found elsewhere; the decorative forms on the tower - \
abstract circles and squares - look almost modernist in their restraint.

Of many points of note inside, Shrub was impressed by stone columns \
baked pink by the fires that periodically gutted the building, while \
The Spesh liked the civil war relics such as the musket ball lodged \
in a tomb; an enraged puritan had shot carved bosses of the Virgin \
Mary in the ceiling, and, as an enthusiastic guide explained the tale, \
The Spesh could almost hear the sound of the ricocheting projectile \
echoing round the nave.

The cloisters, dating from when there was an abbey on-site and hosting \
a slightly-too-easy labyrinth, are undoubtedly a good spot for lounging \
about on the grass on a bright afternoon. Adjacent to this, an excellent \
wooden structure, less than ten years old, houses a new refectory. Our \
adventurers arrived close to closing time - a deal on the remaining \
cakes, plump and very tasty, meant they ate with both great enjoyment \
and economy. The cheerful staff and shimmering trees brushing against \
the windows completed the scene: the best caf√© of the tour so far? It \
might well be.

On the way back to the station, an errant guest from a nearby wedding \
reception pointed out falcons nesting in the cathedral‚Äôs spire. They \
really are a cheerful lot in Norwich. Even the Canaries fans that \
filled the station after beating Reading seemed chilled and good \
natured, although match-day trouble was probably unlikely at this most \
middle-class of Premiership fixtures: the teams‚Äô two sponsors - Aviva \
and Waitrose - say it all."""}, {

town of Guildford with lunch in the White House, a busy riverside \
pub near the station. Shrub arrived with his family after a \
gruelling car trip across the motorways of southern England, and \
the beer garden soon heaved with the pushchairs and tupperware \
that tumbled out of his Peugeot. It was a pleasant spot, and our \
troupe were soon fortified for their stroll to the cathedral.

Sited on a prominent hill at the foot of the Hog‚Äôs Back ridge, Guildford \
cathedral enjoys a fantastic location. The angel at the top of the \
cathedral‚Äôs tower was recently regilded courtesy of the telecoms \
companies who own transmitters in her torso. She now shimmers in the \
morning sun, beaming phone chatter across the Surrey landscape, \
with each change in the wind swinging her to face a new spectacular view.

The building, began in 1936, is as tasteful modern interpretation of \
the traditional English cathedral: no radical change of layout or \
fancy materials: the interior is clad in unadorned caramel-coloured \
limestone: the exterior is a giant brick structure reminiscent of \
the pre-war power stations. It was built slowly through the \
mid-twentieth century as funds allowed. Construction stopped during \
the second world war leaving partially-complete works on the hill \
that many locals were convinced made ideal waymarkers for the \
Luftwaffe. In the 1950s, the cash-strapped diocese invited the town‚Äôs \
residents to buy individual bricks and have their names marked on \
the clay. A brick by the Queen remains on display. Now, fifty years \
after the cathedral was consecrated, a new funding crisis looms: \
the roof has aged badly. The ceiling‚Äôs deterioration is clearly \
visible and the whole structure needs to be substantially replaced; \
the cost will be high: just removing all the asbestos will cost millions. \
The hat is being passed round again: let‚Äôs hope the IT consultants \
and merchant bankers who fill the borough dig deep.

The trip closed with a visit to the cathedral‚Äôs refectory. This brought \
back bittersweet memories for The Spesh: it was the venue for his \
grandmother‚Äôs wake. The bright room was spacious and reassuring in \
the tradition of the better 1960s architecture. The tea and cakes \
were enjoyable. Opening hours are limited: try to check this before '
you visit.

Finally, an odd bit of trivia: movie fans will recognise Guildford \
cathedral from the 1976 film The Omen, where the infant antichrist \
refuses to cross the cathedral‚Äôs threshold, screaming from the back \
of an ambassadorial car at the sight of the building‚Äôs understated \
facade. Readers will be reassured that Shrub‚Äôs own offspring remained \
placid and content throughout the visit."""
