.. TEASER_END

This epic reaches its Devonian Period, with a visit to Exeter. After weeks of rain, a stroll through the town's sun-soaked streets heartened Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh no end. They soon reached the cathedral's splendid grounds brimming with contented westcountryfolk lounging in the midday warmth. Our heroes' only complaint was the amplified Spanish guitar music that boomed through the scene and prompted them to find lunch elsewhere: they enjoyed a refreshing drink in The Ship Inn, with its doubtful links to Sir Francis Drake, and an al fresco ploughmans in the yet-more tenously-connected Drake's Cafe, next to House \
of Fraser.

Squat, long and broad, Exeter cathedral has a unique layout. There is no central tower - the collapse of Winchester's gave the bishop commissioning Exeter's Gothic rebuild the jitters. Instead, two Norman towers from the original structure flank the later nave: this plan gives Exeter the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling of all England's cathedrals: its attractively-coloured stonework reminded Sneak of his \
mum's new patio.

The choir was practicing while Shrub, Sneak and The Spesh ambled round the building's interior; the collected voices and many-piped organ filled the great space with delicate and timeless harmonies, and Shrub enjoyed watching the enthusiastic conductor chappie encourage his diverse charges to refine and perfect their performance. The singing continued during the early-afternoon tour, where a cravatted guide in a cream suit occasionally had to pause his amusing tales of bishop this-or-that when a particularly-tumultuous crescendo of voices overwhelmed his own. He also punctuated his talk with updates on the qualifying for the Spanish grand prix, which The Spesh found helpful. \

Amongst the usual bits and bobs that fill the nation's cathedrals (stacks of chairs, scarred regimental standards, pianos under tarps), Exeter's treasures include the giant carved bishop's seat (saved from a German bomb in 1942 by cathedral bosses who shifted it to storage) and an astronomical clock that was once the only timepiece in the westcountry. The clock was guarded by a cathedral cat who prowled its workings to snare the mice that chewed the fat-soaked ropes carrying its weights, and supposedly inspired (i.e. did not inspire) the lyrics to Hickory Dickory Dock. Another impressive feature is the magnificent carved screen at the front of the cathedral, loaded with various apostles and assorted Biblical bods at different stages of erosion.

Exeter's cafe is a real find. The trio struggled to find anything to fault in this delighful eatery, with its lovely setting, cheerful staff and tasty homemade cakes. The visitor can choose between settling down in its magnificent Victorian gothic revival interior (with glowing stained glass and an ornately-decorated stone ceiling) or heading outside to benches beneath the cathedral itself. Our adventurers chose to sun themselves while enjoying a big pot of tea and a generous serving of scones, jam and clotted cream. The cream tea was, of course, obligatory (given they were in Devon) and, luckily, completely delicious. Indeed, The Spesh ate far too much - he still felt slightly queasy hours later.

Clositers Cafe

This cafe served Doom Bar straight from the barrel — heavenly. Also a cracking cup of tea here. Plenty of *home-made* cakes — a must for the respect of CC. The Devon cream-teas were delicious and had a very generous serving of clotted cream.
