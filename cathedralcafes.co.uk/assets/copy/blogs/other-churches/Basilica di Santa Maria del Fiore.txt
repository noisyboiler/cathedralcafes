When any member of Cathedral Cafes finds themselves in a hotel adjacent to a giant cathedral it is highly likely that said church will receive some degree of attention - and that is exactly what has happened here in Florence.

Luckily for the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Flower we only score against the Church of England. Granted it has an amazing painted dome but not only are the few notable dead people simply popes (a futile effort to win points) but it doesn't even have a cafe!

However, it's been an enjoyable experience; a popular one too as the queues of tourists will demonstrate (see photo). Once inside it's spacious and remarkably barren bar features at each extremity and the painted dome. This is a surprise because the exterior is an elaborate display of intriguing features painted in greens, pinks and whites.

The dome is what most tourists are here to see and with a handful of Euros you can climb up to the gods and get a closer look. I am both scared of heights and gods so I saved my pennies. But a stand-out church this is.
