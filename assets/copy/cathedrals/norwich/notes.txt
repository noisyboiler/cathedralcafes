** Norwich **

In medieval Norwich this was not a popular church. Prior to the Norman invasion, Norwich was a happy-go-lucky little Anglo-Saxon town with happy people, many quaint little churches and a thriving marketplace - Tombland. Herbert de Losinga's bullish Norman planning then set the cat amongst the pigeons.

A relatively quick build, 1096 - 1145, the church required the demolition of the towns marketplace, two churches and a few houses. This was not long after 80 or so houses and 25 hectares of land were lost to the build of the Norman's castle. The church split the town in two, quite literally. On one side was the French Borough of Norman immigrants and on the other, the good, honest, hard-working Anglo-Saxon folk - understandably quite bitter!

Out of this hotbed of dissent a beautiful Norman cathedral was crafted. This is England's most complete Norman cathedral. Bar the replacement of the wooden roof and spire with material more tollerant to large-scale fire, this is the church that the first monks prayed in. The unpopular priory continued to exist for around 400 years, when they voluntarily left.

To put events into perspective, this priory was so unpopular Norwich became the only English city to be excommunicated by the Pope following the riot of 1272.

The church is stunning. At completion it had the longest nave in England, highest spire and largest cloisters. It does have the largest collection of bosses in Christendom. And at the time of our visit, it's own maze. Tombland is now a lovely cathedral precinct and the modern cafe stands our amongst it's contemporaries.

Must dos: find original wall paintings, decipher some bosses, go to the cafe.



** Architecture **

Perpendicular vaulting

The original wooden roof proved rather susceptible to fire and following a lightening strike on the spire in 1483, the roof needed replacing. Stone was preferred this time and the style of vaulting of the age was Perpendicular. This is a Gothic style, early 15th century, and basically means lots vertical lines. Norwich has one of England's finest examples of this.

2nd largest cloisters

And as we were lucky enough to discover, has room for a maze. Which town do you think built a larger cloisters about 100 years later?

2nd largest spire

Original spire collapsed in 1361, but by this time it had already been beaten into second (can you guess who by?). The next spire hosted a lightening strike + fire in 1483. 3rd spire is still in action today, and still taller than all except.....?

Near-complete Norman church

Many cathedrals undergo numerous architectural changes, improvements or acts of god. But Norwich remains as close to the original as we have in England. In fact, it is one of Europes finest original, untouched examples of Norman architecture.


Largest cathedral close in England

Around the size of a small marketpalce. Tombland (the original marketplace, church and houses) is basically now the cathedral close/precinct. It has more people living within it than any other close in England. No pubs though.


Cloister

The only 2 story cloister in England. Yep, that's right. Unless Salisbury has been building again.


** Cafe **

Winner, National Wood Awards 2004

A stand-out building and winner of the prestigious Wood Award (http://www.woodawards.com/about-us/) in 2004.

Cakes

A great range of home made cakes, best so far. A proper tasting was had here by the CC team. The tea was good and strong, the service was chirpy and prompt. We even heard the cheers of the Norwich city fans in the wind as their favourite team scored. Victory.


** Treasures **

Original wall paintings

The raucous reformation that we had led to a lot of vandalism throughout many of our churches. They were not so thorough at The Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, and if you ascend the narrow spiral staircase to the treasury you will get to see some beautiful original wall paintings. 

61 Misericords

Medieval churches often fitted these 'mercy seats', slightly reducing the discomfort for those forced to stand for hours upon end. These date from 1480 to the mid-19th century.

The largest collection of bosses in Christendom

The cloisters have 396 bosses. In fact bosses are everywhere here - 1106 in total. And for the trained monk they tell a story and can be read like a book as you enter and leave the church. This idea - using bosses to tell a story - is possibly Norwiches greatest contributions to medieval art. For example, above Christ's head you'll find the story of The Passion, and the cloisters tell the story of The Apocalypse, twice over. There are some easier ones to spot in Lyhart's vault: Noah's Ark, Christ's baptism, and his death.



** Stories, Trivia **

Perriguines (http://upp.hawkandowl.org/norwich-peregrines/live-peregrine-web-cam-2013/)

Norwich cathedral is home to a family of Periguin Falcons. Lucky people will see them flying about looking for small rodents to kill. We were lucky enough (by seconds) to meet people who had been lucky enough to have just seen this. Damn it.

Pink Stones

In 1463 the spire was struck by lightning, causing a fire to rage through the nave which was so intense it turned some of the creamy Caen limestone a pink colour


No Bells! 

What??? A church with no belss? Actually one of 3 without. The residence of the close are no doubt pleased about this.


Bullet Holes

An angry Puritan mob invaded the cathedral and destroyed all Catholic symbols in 1643. The mob also fired their muskets. At least one musket ball remains lodged in the stonework.

Films

The cathedral was used as a location for the 2013 film Jack the Giant Slayer. (We also are not aware of this production)

The earliest record of Blood Libel

In 1144 a young christian child called William was found brutally murderd in the local woods. The death was attributed to a ritual murder by the local Jewish population. The story was turned into a cult, William acquiring the status of martyr and subsequently being canonised. The cult of St William attracted large numbers of pilgrims, bringing wealth to the local church. On 6 February 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle.

German Bomb

There is giant unexploded bomb in the close. With the boggy land the damn thing just kept on sinking when safety experts tried to extrapolate it. So they left it there.

labyrinth

We arrived with good fortune and were able to attempt the Golden Jubille commemerative maze. 


** Dead People **

St William (of Norwich), Child Martyr (d 1144)

The child that more proabably was bruttally murderd by his uncle.


Sir Thomas Erpingham, Knight of the Garter (c. 1355–1428)

Commander of King Henry V's English and Welsh archers at the Battle of Agincour, and builder of The Erpingham Gate in 1420.
